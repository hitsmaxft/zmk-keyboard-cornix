# ZMK Keyboard for Cornix

## Introduction to Boards and Shields

This repository contains the ZMK firmware configuration for the Cornix split keyboard. Below is an explanation of the different boards and shields available in this project:

### Boards

The project includes three main board definitions:

- **`cornix_left`**: The left half of the Cornix split keyboard, used when building firmware without a dongle configuration.
- **`cornix_right`**: The right half of the Cornix split keyboard, used for the slave side in split keyboard setup.
- **`cornix_ph_left`**: Alternative left half board configuration, specifically designed for use with a dongle setup.

### Shields

The project includes several specialized shields that provide additional functionality:

- **`cornix_dongle_adapter`**: Provides common functionality for the matrix and Bluetooth functionality for dongle configurations. This shield is required when using the Cornix with a custom dongle.
- **`cornix_dongle_eyelash`**: An example shield for setting up display device for the dongle board. This is used when the board doesn't already have `zephyr,display` in the device tree.
- **`cornix_indicator`**: A shield that enables RGB LED indicators for battery status and connection status. Note that using this shield consumes more power.

## warning：device breakdown recovery

the original cornix use flash layout without softdevice
so in the project. all board use nosd layout as default 

if you flash firmware into dongle and found it can't work with the original  firmware 
you have two solutions 

1. （recommend）flash the sd restore uf2 under boooader direcotry（its for nice nano 2 ，but i think it works for most of nrf52840 device） other boards https://github.com/hitsmaxft/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/actions/runs/18398554358
2. build your firmware  with snippet  'nrf
52840-nosd', make zmk ignore soft device 


## TODO LIST

- [x] 52 keys full layout keymap, since v2.0
- [x] ec11 encoder, since v2.2
- [x] no-SD image, since v2.3
- [x] support various of dongles
- [x] upgrade to zephyr4.1 and lvgl9 , since v2.7, no dongle screen support yet
- [ ] rgb since in future v3


### about RGB

Cornix shield has 2 RGB LEDs on each side, controled by PWM in the stock firmware.

The replacement solution is adapting the RGB indicator module to light up these RGBs, to achieve the same effect as the stock firmware, which uses the RGB LEDs to indicate battery status and connection status.

But it is not supported yet in this repository.  PR is welcome!

## Supported Hardware: Cornix Split Keyboard

Cornix Split Tented Low‑Profile Ergo Keyboard (Jezail Funder)

Cornix is a Corne‑inspired split ergonomic keyboard featuring a compact 3×6 column‑staggered layout with six thumb‑cluster keys (three per half). It offers adjustable tenting angles at 10°, 18°, and 25°, allowing users to reduce wrist strain and find a custom ergonomic alignment

- **Split, column‑staggered layout** (3×6 + thumb cluster layout).
- **Adjustable tenting support** at 10°, 18°, 25° (hardware‑based, no firmware hacks).
- **Kailh Choc V2 hot‑swap sockets** and support for LAK or LCK low‑profile keycaps.
- **Dual‑mode connectivity**: Wired USB‑C or Bluetooth wireless (left half as master).
- **Firmware**: Fully VIAL‑supported for keymaps and layer customization, stock firmware is RMK.
- Premium **CNC‑machined aluminum chassis**, custom damping foam, and portable storage pouch.

> this project owner is RMK contributor too, support RMK https://rmk.rs/ please

## --Bootloader Recovery Instructions--

-- The original RMK firmware removed the SoftDevice, so before flashing `zmk.uf2`, you need to restore the SoftDevice first. For specific steps, please refer to [bootloader/README.md](./bootloader/README.md). --

Since v2.3 this board' flash partitions has updated, removed SD (reducing sd partitionsize size from 150K to 4K), so You can flash firmware directly.

> You may need to reset fw by reset.uf2 from ealier version

> You can rollback to stock firmware by flash orgin uf2 file, backup files under rmkfw/

> - ZMK Configuration: https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup

### Step 2: Add Cornix Shield to Your Project

After initializing your zmk-config repository, follow the steps in the next section to integrate the Cornix shield.

## How to Add Cornix Shield to Existing ZMK Project

For users with existing zmk-config, add this repository dependency via west.yml and pull the latest version via west update:

### 1. Modify west.yml

Edit the `config/west.yml` file, add to the `manifest/remotes` section:

```yaml
remotes:
  - name: zmkfirmware
    url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
  - name: cornix-shield
    url-base: https://github.com/hitsmaxft
  - name: urob
    url-base: https://github.com/urob
```

Add to the `manifest/projects` section:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: zmk
    remote: zmkfirmware
    revision: main
    import: app/west.yml
  - name: zmk-keyboard-cornix
    remote: cornix-shield
    revision: main
  - name: zmk-helpers
    remote: urob
    revision: main
```

### 2. Update Dependencies

```bash
west update
```

### 3. Configure Build

Edit the `build.yaml` file, add:

> [!NOTE]
> 1. If you are using (default) cornix without dongle, choose "cornix_left", "cornix_right" and "reset".
> 2. If you are using cornix with dongle, choose "cornix_dongle". "cornix_left_for_dongle", "cornix_right" and "reset".
> 3. Add "cornix_indicator" shield to enable RGB led light. It consumes much more power, use at your own risk.

```yaml
include:
  # Use cornix with dongle
  - board: nice_nano
    shield: cornix_dongle_adaptor cornix_dongle_eyelash dongle_display
    snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
    artifact-name: cornix_dongle

  - board: cornix_ph_left
    # shield: cornix_indicator
    artifact-name: cornix_left_for_dongle

  # Use cornix without dongle
  - board: cornix_left
    # shield: cornix_indicator
    artifact-name: cornix_left

  - board: cornix_right
    # shield: cornix_indicator
    artifact-name: cornix_right

  - board: cornix_right
    shield: settings_reset
    artifact-name: reset
```

### 4. Build Firmware

Use your preferred method to build

- no need to recovery the sd since 2.3
- falsh reset.uf2 both side of cornix
- flash left and right uf2 files
- reset both side at the same time.

### 5. Flash Firmware

Flash the generated `.uf2` files to the corresponding microcontroller:
- Left half: `build/left/zephyr/zmk.uf2`
- Right half: `build/right/zephyr/zmk.uf2`

## Dongle Adapter Shield for Custom Dongle Users

For users who want to create their own custom dongle configurations, this repository provides a adapter shield. The complete configuration for the Cornix dongle can use multiple shields:

1. **`cornix_dongle_adapter`** - This is the common shield for the matrix and Bluetooth functionality
2. **`dongle_display`** - This is the display module for the dongle screen (or another display project)
3. **`cornix_dongle_eyelash`** - This is an example shield for setting up display device for the board (if the board already has `zephyr,display` in the device tree, this display overlay shield is not needed)

The configuration in the `build.yaml` file shows how to use these shields for the eyelash dongle:
```yaml
include:
  # Use cornix with dongle
  - board: nice_nano
    shield: cornix_dongle_adapter cornix_dongle_eyelash dongle_display
    snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
    artifact-name: cornix_dongle
```

To create a custom shield for the display part:
1. The `dongle_display` module is a module contains display widgets, included as part of the project dependencies via west or locally
2. If you need to create a custom shield for your display hardware, you can create a new shield that provides the appropriate display configuration. Here shows `cornix_dongle_eyelash` as an example
3. If your board already has `zephyr,display` in the device tree, you can omit the `cornix_dongle_eyelash` shield
4. Include your custom shield in the build configuration

For custom dongle screens, add a new target in build.yaml for your custom dongle:
```yaml
- board: nice_nano
  shield: cornix_dongle_adapter cornix_dongle_eyelash dongle_display
  snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart zmk-usb-logging
  artifact-name: cornix_dongle
```

To create a custom shield for your display:
1. Use `cornix_dongle_adapter` as the base shield for the matrix and Bluetooth functionality
2. Add your custom shield in the `build.yaml` file with the appropriate board and configuration
3. Use `cornix_dongle_eyelash` as an example and modify the display parts to match your custom board
4. You can copy the `cornix_dongle_eyelash` into your project's `boards/shield/` directory, and use the same name or rename it as a new shield

The configuration in the `west.yml` file remains the same:
```yaml
remotes:
  - name: zmkfirmware
    url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
  - name: cornix-shield
    url-base: https://github.com/hitsmaxft
  - name: urob
    url-base: https://github.com/urob
```
```yaml
projects:
  - name: zmk
    remote: zmkfirmware
    revision: main
    import: app/west.yml
  - name: zmk-keyboard-cornix
    remote: cornix-shield
    revision: main
  - name: zmk-helpers
    remote: urob
    revision: main
```

## Build This Project Locally (Without west.yaml Dependency)

If you prefer to build this project locally without adding it as a dependency in your west.yaml, you can use the ZMK_EXTRA_MODULES cmake argument.

### Prerequisites

1. Have a working ZMK development environment set up
2. Clone this repository to a local directory

### Build Steps

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hitsmaxft/zmk-keyboard-cornix.git
   ```

2. **Configure your ZMK build with the extra module**:

   Edit your `.west/config` file and add the cmake argument under the `[build]` section:

   ```ini
   [build]
   cmake-args = -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES=/full/absolute/path/to/zmk-keyboard-cornix
   ```

   Replace `/full/absolute/path/to/zmk-keyboard-cornix` with the actual absolute path where you cloned this repository.

3. **Build the firmware**:
   ```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
   west build -b cornix_main_left
=======
   west build -b cornix_left
>>>>>>> 16dcccb (migrate to zephyr4 , disable dongle screen)
   west build -b cornix_right
   ```

This method allows you to use the Cornix shield without modifying your existing ZMK configuration's west.yaml file.
